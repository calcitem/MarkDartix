## Philosophy

ðŸ”‘ Our philosophy is to keep things clean, simple and minimal. 
MarkDartix is constantly changing and we want these improvements to align with our philosophy. For example, look at the side bar and tabs; these two panels provide awesome functionality *and* aren't distracting to the user. We'll continue adding more features (like plugins) that can be activated via 'settings' to improve MarkDartix. This will allow everyone to customize MarkDartix for their needs and provide a minimal default interface.

## Issue Reporting Guidelines

Please search for similar issues before opening an issue and always follow the [issue template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/). Please review the following Pull Request guidelines before making your own PR.

- Utilize [DartDoc](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/documentation) for better code documentation.
